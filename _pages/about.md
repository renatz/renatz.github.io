About Me
======
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU).

My goal is to collect rejection/finding cases from high-ranking tiers of major top conferences,
because I want to see how much someone with zero connections can achieve against the odds.

**Research Interests**
- Natural Language Processing
- Dialog System
- Large Language Model - Role-played LLMs
- Controllable Text Generation
