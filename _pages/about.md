About Me
======
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU).

My goal is to collect rejection/finding cases from high-ranking tiers of major top conferences,
because I want to see how much someone with zero connection can achieve against the odds.

**Research Interests**
- Natural Language Processing
- Dialog System
- Large Language Model - Role-played LLMs
- Controllable Text Generation

Publications
======
+ SHARP: Unlocking Interactive Hallucination via Stance Transfer in Role-Playing LLMs.
  
  Alias: Connection is all your need, role-played LLMs also take their stances based on the connection, regardless of the factuality, much like the shameless human.
  
  **Chuyi Kong**, Ziyang Luo, Hongzhan Lin, Zhiyuan Fan, Yaxin Fan, Yuxi SUN, Jing Ma*
  
  **[ACL'25-Finding]** DEC ARR: OA Ranks <= top 12.67% according to ARR statistics, Meta = 4.

  [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07965v4)]
 
+ PlatoLM: Teaching LLMs in Multi-Round Dialogue via a User Simulator  
  **Chuyi Kong**, Yaxin Fan, Xiang Wan, Feng Jiang*, Benyou Wang.
  
  **[ICLR'24]** 8/6/6/6, OA Ranks top 13% according to crawling, Rejected.
  
  **[ACL'24-Main]** Our model has achieved SoTA performance from 2023/08 to 2023/10 in Alpaca-Eval and MT-Bench.
